This Folder is for maps that are ready for play testing or Completed.

Work In progress maps can be stored in the same directory as mapster32.

I'm loading Resident180.map as the first map in the game just so we have
a map load up when you start a new game.

I guessing that the game will not have a map to map progression but a hub system
where you can back track and move throughout the game.
