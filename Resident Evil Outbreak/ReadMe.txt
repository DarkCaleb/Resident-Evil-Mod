This Folder is the base GAME folder.

This is where you put eduke32.exe and mapster32.exe.

for now you also need to put duke3d.grp here for the game to load.
I'll making the game independent of the duke3d.grp later.

This is also where eduke32.exe and mapster32.exe logs, cfg and setting files will be stored. 
Mapster32 also saves maps here.

=====!!IMPORTANT!!=========!!IMPORTANT!!=========!!IMPORTANT!!=====
Use ResidentEvil-Mapster32.bat to load mapster32 with the mod Data.
